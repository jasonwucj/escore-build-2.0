Introduction
------------

The escore-build project builds everything in a clean mock chroot
environment just like redhat/centos does.

The iso build process is based on lorax - a open source iso build
tool from redhat/centos.  The result iso is anaconda install iso -
yet another redhat/centos open source software.


Scripts
-------

setup.sh:
 -> Copy the necessary settings and initialize mock environment.
    This script should be used before running other scripts.

build_iso.sh:
 -> Build ESCore iso image.

make_repos.sh:
 -> Create easystack repository for mock / installer / iso environment.
    Someone has to migrate the result repos to the server for the
    httpd and rsyncd services.

shell.sh:
 -> Enter mock environment if one would like to try some commands.

common.sh:
 -> This contains necessary settings and variables.
    All other shell scripts are supposed to source it.

clean.sh:
 -> Cleanup mock cache and all the stuff we created.


Note
----

1. Since we use mock environment to build packages and iso image, a user
   should become a member of the mock group by adding their username
   to the mock line in /etc/group.
   This can be done with the following command:

     $ sudo /usr/sbin/usermod -a -G mock $USER

2. During the process we need stuff provided by http and rsync services from remote.
   So make sure that the services are available on the server and the directory
   locations are correct.

     http://[remote]/ESCore/CentOS/7.3.1611/os
     http://[remote]/ESCore/CentOS/7.3.1611/updates
     http://[remote]/ESCore/CentOS/7.3.1611/easystack
     rsync://[remote]/escore_repo
