Introduction
------------

The escore-build project builds everything in a clean mock chroot
environment just like redhat/centos does. 

The iso build process is based on lorax - a open source iso build
tool from redhat/centos.  The result iso is anaconda install iso -
yet another redhat/centos open source software.


Note
----

1. Since we use mock environment to build packages and iso image, a user
   should become a member of the mock group by adding their username
   to the mock line in /etc/group.
   This can be done with the following command:

     $ sudo /usr/sbin/usermod -a -G mock $USER
