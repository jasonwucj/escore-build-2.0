Introduction
------------

The escore-build project builds everything in a clean mock chroot
environment just like redhat/centos does. 

The iso build process is based on lorax - a open source iso build
tool from redhat/centos.  The result iso is anaconda install iso -
yet another redhat/centos open source software.


Note
----

1. Since we use mock environment to build packages and iso image, a user
   should become a member of the mock group by adding their username
   to the mock line in /etc/group.
   This can be done with the following command:

     $ sudo /usr/sbin/usermod -a -G mock $USER

2. During the process we need stuff provided by http and rsync services from remote.
   So make sure that the services are available on the server and the directory
   locations are correct.

     http://[remote]/ESCore/CentOS/7.3.1611/os
     http://[remote]/ESCore/CentOS/7.3.1611/updates
     http://[remote]/ESCore/CentOS/7.3.1611/easystack
     rsync://[remote]/escore_repo
