Introduction
------------

The escore-build project builds everything in a clean mock chroot
environment just like redhat/centos does. 

The iso build process is based on lorax - a open source iso build
tool from redhat/centos.  The result iso is anaconda install iso -
yet another redhat/centos open source software.
